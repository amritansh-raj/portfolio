## Overview

Developed the official web platform for INNOTECH 2024, the flagship innovation and entrepreneurship event of KIET Group of Institutions, themed around "Smart Solutions for Viksit Bharat." The platform facilitated multi-tier registration processes for schools and colleges, streamlined team management, enabled real-time project submissions, and provided dynamic judging and reporting capabilities — all crafted with a modern, scalable architecture.

## Key Features

- **School and College Registration**: Handled separate registration flows for school participants and college students with tailored onboarding experiences.
- **Dynamic Team Formation and Invitations**: Allowed students to form teams, send invites, and manage team membership prior to final project submission.
- **Project Submission Module**: Enabled seamless submission of project abstracts and details, with support for multiple updates before deadlines.
- **Flexible Judging System**: Integrated a dynamic judging mechanism where criteria varied based on project type, enabling customized evaluation forms for different categories.
- **Real-Time Report Generation**: Delivered instant calculation and reporting of evaluation scores, with real-time aggregation visible to admins and organizers.
- **Modern UI Enhancements**: Included interactive UI elements using Three.js to deliver a visually appealing, engaging user experience.
- **Global State Management**: Efficiently managed multi-page and multi-role data using Redux for consistent performance across the platform.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18**: For building a fast, responsive, and component-driven front-end architecture.
- **Ant Design and Tailwind CSS**: For crafting sleek, accessible, and highly functional forms and layouts.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For maintaining a robust and scalable global state across multiple modules and user flows.
- **Axios**: For smooth, promise-based API communications.
- **Three.js**: For bringing interactive and visually enriched 3D elements into the platform's UI.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was architecting the complex flow of team formation and project submission while maintaining flexibility — including edge cases like reassigning team members or updating submissions close to deadlines. Handling dynamic judging criteria based on project types required building a flexible evaluation system capable of real-time score calculation and aggregation. Ensuring consistency across role-based workflows (students, judges, admins) taught valuable lessons in modular front-end design, API optimization, and efficient global state handling. Incorporating Three.js without compromising performance further refined expertise in balancing rich UI with real-world speed requirements.

## Outcome

The platform successfully managed hundreds of school and college participants, enabling smooth team collaboration, submission handling, and a frictionless judging experience at INNOTECH 2024. Real-time reporting and dynamic evaluation tools greatly reduced operational overhead for organizers. The combination of a modern UI, flexible backend integration, and performance-focused design contributed to a seamless event experience, promoting innovation, collaboration, and smart solutions under the initiative of "Smart Solutions for Viksit Bharat."
