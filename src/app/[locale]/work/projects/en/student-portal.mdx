## Overview

Development of a modern, high-performance Student Portal for KIET Group of Institutions using Create React App, integrating Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and advanced state management via Redux Toolkit.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard and Attendance Overview**: Interactive dashboard displaying overall attendance via donut charts and detailed tables using apexcharts and chart.js.
- **Personalized Class Schedule**: Dynamically generated class schedule tailored to each student’s daily timetable.
- **Interactive Calendar**: Integrated calendar component with holidays and important dates highlighted for better planning.
- **Academic Resources**: Easy access to scores, datesheets, hall tickets, and test registration functionalities.
- **Installment-Based Fee Payment**: Enabled students to pay academic and hostel fees in installments, with schedules generated by the HRMS software, integrated seamlessly into the portal.
- **Grievance and Suggestion System**: Anonymous feedback and grievance submission platform to improve student engagement and campus life.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Offline access and caching capabilities enabled through Workbox for a seamless experience even without internet connectivity.
- **Error Handling and Forms**: Robust form validation using Formik and Yup, consistent error handling using Axios and SweetAlert2, and high-functionality tables with MUI DataTables.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js (CRA)**: For building the core front-end application.
- **Material UI and Tailwind CSS**: For building a modern, responsive, and visually appealing UI.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For managing global asynchronous state across the portal.
- **ApexCharts and Chart.js**: For implementing rich, interactive data visualizations.
- **Formik and Yup**: For comprehensive form validation and management.
- **MUI-Datatables**: For powerful, feature-rich tabular data management.
- **Axios and SweetAlert2**: For API communications and user-friendly alerts.
- **Workbox**: For enabling offline support and PWA features.

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was balancing performance and user experience for over 8,000+ daily active users. Efficient state management, optimizing data-fetching strategies, and implementing offline support were crucial. The integration of fee payment modules while securely handling financial data based on HRMS-generated installments required precise synchronization with external systems. Handling real-time data updates, ensuring smooth workflows across various services, and maintaining student anonymity in grievance modules also contributed to technical growth.

## Outcome

The Student Portal is now actively used daily by all students at KIET Group of Institutions, streamlining academic, financial, and administrative processes. The addition of the installment-based fee payment system further enhanced the portal’s utility, reducing administrative workload and offering students greater flexibility. The transformation into a Progressive Web App has improved usability and resilience, leading to widespread adoption and positive feedback across the campus.
