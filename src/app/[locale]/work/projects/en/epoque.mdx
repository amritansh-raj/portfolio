## Challenges and Learnings

Managing event-wise dynamic eligibility and cross-level participant promotions posed significant architectural challenges. Each eventâ€™s custom judging parameters demanded a flexible, event-specific evaluation and promotion system. Additionally, implementing QR-based entry management with real-time verification, while ensuring a smooth UX, sharpened backend interaction handling. Securely integrating payments for external users while maintaining distinct flows for internal students provided valuable insights into user segmentation and transaction flow management.

## Outcome

The platform successfully registered and managed thousands of participants across various events, levels, and institutions. Automated judging workflows and QR-based access reduced manual errors and operational overhead, ensuring a seamless event experience.
